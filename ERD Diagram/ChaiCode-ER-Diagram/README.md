[![Deployed on Vercel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deployed%20on-Vercel-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel&logoColor=white)](https://er-diagram-viewer.vercel.app)

**Repository:** [github.com/Armaan-Dip-Singh-Maan/ChaiCode-ER-Diagram](https://github.com/Armaan-Dip-Singh-Maan/ChaiCode-ER-Diagram)

This repo contains **three interactive ER diagrams** in one app: use the top tabs to switch boards (or open `#thrift`, `#fitness`, or `#clinic` in the URL).

Built with React (`src/ERDiagram.jsx`, `src/FitnessCoachingERDiagram.jsx`, `src/ClinicERDiagram.jsx`). Run locally with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

## Page 2 — Online fitness coaching (ChaiCode assignment)

Interactive ER diagram for an **online fitness coaching platform** (not gym floor management): trainers onboard clients, sell plans, schedule consultations and live sessions, manage subscriptions and payments, and track progress through structured metrics, weekly check-ins, and separate coach notes.

### Assignment timeline (ChaiCode / evaluation)

| Milestone | Date & time (2026) |
| --- | --- |
| **Start** | Apr 6, 11:30 PM |
| **Due** | Apr 7, 1:00 PM |
| **Eval begins** | Apr 7, 1:30 PM |
| **Eval ends** | Apr 8, 12:29 PM |

### Business problem (summary)

A fitness influencer runs **online coaching**: some clients buy **long-term plans**, some only want **consultations**, some get **live sessions** while others receive **routines and diet guidance**. The database must support onboarding, **subscriptions**, **scheduled sessions**, **weekly check-ins**, **progress** (weight, measurements, reports), and **trainer notes**, with clear separation from core user identity.

### Design highlights

| Topic | How it is modeled |
| --- | --- |
| **Trainers vs clients** | `User` is the identity table; `Trainer` and `Client` each reference `user_id` (one profile each when applicable). |
| **Plans vs purchases** | `Plan` is the catalog (created by a trainer). `Subscription` is an **enrollment**: which `client_id`, which `plan_id`, **start/end dates**, **status**, and `assigned_trainer_id`. Many clients can enroll in the same plan over time; one client can have many subscriptions over time. |
| **Sessions vs check-ins** | `Session` = scheduled **calendar** events (consultation, live call, etc.), with optional `subscription_id`. `CheckIn` = **async** periodic client reports — different entity. |
| **Progress** | `ProgressEntry` holds metrics (`weight_kg`, `body_measurements` JSON, etc.), not merged into `User` / `Client`. |
| **Trainer feedback** | `TrainerNote` is separate from `CheckIn` and optional `subscription_id` for context. |
| **Workouts & diet** | Kept **abstract** on `Plan` (`plan_kind`, `workout_diet_abstract`) so the ER stays practical; detailed program tables can be added later without breaking core relationships. |
| **Payments** | `Payment` references `subscription_id` with **1:N** cardinality for renewals, partial payments, or refund rows. |

**Entities (10):** `User`, `Trainer`, `Client`, `Plan`, `Subscription`, `Payment`, `Session`, `CheckIn`, `ProgressEntry`, `TrainerNote`.

### Diagram assets

| Asset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Interactive app** | Primary deliverable — pan/zoom-friendly SVG entities with **PK** / **FK** labels and relationship cardinalities (Fitness tab). |
| **Static export** | Optional: add `docs/images/er-diagram-fitness-full.png` after `npm run build && npm run preview` and a screenshot if you want a PNG in-repo. |

### Submission checklist (course expectations)

- Single coherent board (this repo: interactive pages + optional PNG under `docs/images/`).
- Readable layout, labeled **PK** / **FK**, cardinalities on relationship lines.
- Trainers, clients, plans, subscriptions, sessions, check-ins, progress, payments, and separate trainer notes represented with sensible cardinalities.

## Page 3 — Clinic appointment & diagnostics (Web Dev Cohort 2026)

Interactive ER diagram for a **clinic** that manages doctors, patients, **appointments** (scheduled intent), **consultations** (actual visits), prescribed **diagnostic tests**, **reports** generated later, and **payments** tied to booking and/or the visit.

### Assignment timeline (Databases / evaluation)

| Milestone | Date & time (2026) |
| --- | --- |
| **Start** | Apr 7, 11:30 PM |
| **Due** | Apr 8, 1:00 PM |
| **Eval begins** | Apr 8, 1:30 PM |
| **Eval ends** | Apr 9, 12:29 AM |

### Design highlights

| Topic | How it is modeled |
| --- | --- |
| **Appointment vs consultation** | `Appointment` = booked slot and status (cancelled, no-show, etc.). `Consultation` = real encounter; optional `appointment_id` (**NULL** = walk-in). At most one consultation per appointment when the visit occurs. |
| **Doctor specialty** | `Specialty` is a **reference entity**; `Doctor` references it (scalable reporting). `Department` is separate for physical / org grouping. |
| **Tests** | `DiagnosticTest` = catalog. `TestOrder` = line items per consultation — **one consultation → many test orders**; tests are **not** duplicated on `Patient` alone. |
| **Reports** | `Report` is **1:1** with `TestOrder`; `patient_id` on `Report` supports quick patient history without extra joins. |
| **Payments** | `Payment` links to `patient_id` and optionally `appointment_id` and/or `consultation_id` (booking deposit vs visit/diagnostics); `payment_for` disambiguates. |

**Entities (10):** `Department`, `Specialty`, `Doctor`, `Patient`, `Appointment`, `Consultation`, `DiagnosticTest`, `TestOrder`, `Report`, `Payment`.
